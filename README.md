## Who is this for?
I have many interests and to make sure that I give each of them enough time 
during the week, I schedule my days. Currently I use Excel to make such a 
schedule, but I find it cumbersome to edit and I don't really like to overhead 
and portability problems of an Excel file, instead of a simple HTML file (or 
PDF).

This tool is for people who wants to make simple schedules and make them look 
good.
